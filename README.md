# Credit-Building
## A credit score concept to help underserved customers

My teammate and I worked on a concept during our Master's of Management in Analytics where we put our data management knowledge into practice. 
The exercise was to demonstrate our ability to design a data structure of how it will come together to solve the problem statement. 

Our problem statement stemmed from the idea that current credit scores are outdated and require a new approach from the traditional models. 
Compared to many years ago, consumers now have many automated payments with the services we have today. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Audible, among many others are classic examples of some products we consume today. 
From this idea, we built a concept using Barker's notation and fake data to replicate what it would look like.
