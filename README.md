# Credit-Building
## A credit score concept to help underserved customers

My teammate (KJ) and I worked on a concept during our Master's of Management in Analytics where we put our data management knowledge into practice. 
The exercise was to demonstrate our ability to design a data structure of how it will come together to solve the problem statement. 

Our problem statement stemmed from the idea that current credit scores are outdated and require a new approach.
Traditional models often relied on your credit history, such as amount owing, late payments, among other metrics.
Today, consumers have many automated payments with the services we have today. Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Audible, among many others are classic examples of the products that we consume today. Additionally, rent payments, hydro bills, phone bills are other services that are often overlooked. 

From this idea, we built a concept using Barker's notation and fake data to replicate what it would look like if banks and credit companies collaborated to incorporate these new metrics to determine a consumers credit worthiness. 

We conceptualized this idea by developing a relational database to start and then began curating synthetic data.
